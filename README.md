This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

### Version
3.2.0

### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
* [Marked] - a super fast port of Markdown to JavaScript
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [keymaster.js] - awesome keyboard handler lib by [@thomasfuchs]
* [jQuery] - duh

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
